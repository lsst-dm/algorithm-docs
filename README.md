This repository is a loosely organized collection of documents that describe
the image processing algorithms we are using (or are considering using) in the
LSST software stack.  It should not contain documents whose primary job is
to explain how to use or build on top of the LSST codebase, but it can hold
documents that describe at a higher level what's going on under the hood.

Smaller snippets of useful math, larger explanatory papers, and presentation
slide are all welcome, in any format.

Please add put each document in a new directory, and please provide a build
system if appropriate.

Documents important for LSST planning and design should have a direct link
added from Confluence at
https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2065008.
